# Feature: Post-Process Bundle

## Current Feature Branch
```
feature/post-process
```

## Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] Update lora_mover.py with standardized two-step UI
- [x] Update lora_sync.py with standardized two-step UI
- [x] Create download_output.py with standardized two-step UI
- [x] Update easy.py to include the new download_output command
- [x] Initial implementation of post-process bundle (pp) command

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test all implementations with real config data
- [ ] Document the new functionality
- [ ] Enhanced bundle orchestrator with better error handling
- [ ] Final integration testing

## Implementation Details

### Standardized Two-Step UI ✅
All tools now follow the standardized UI pattern as defined in the knowledge checkpoint:
- First step: Select config family (prefix) from a two-column layout
- Second step: Select specific config or "all"
- Consistent styling with blue panel borders
- Yellow numbering
- Gold panel titles

### download_output.py ✅
The new script has been successfully implemented with:
1. The standardized two-step UI for configuration selection
2. Output content filtering:
   - Keeps only the highest checkpoint folder
   - Excludes validation_images folder
   - Excludes pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors files
3. Dropbox upload with proper path structure:
   - Destination: /studio/ai/data/1models/013-{Family}/4training/output/{config_name}
4. Local cleanup of inferior checkpoints after successful upload

### lora_mover.py ✅
The script has been updated to:
1. Implement the standardized two-step UI selection pattern
2. Maintain proper Dropbox path handling for sync operations
3. Ensure consistent styling with other tools

### lora_sync.py ✅
The script has been updated to:
1. Implement the standardized two-step UI selection pattern
2. Improve Dropbox path handling
3. Ensure consistent styling with other tools

### Post-Process Bundle (pp) ✅
Initial implementation for the bundled workflow:
1. Streamlined execution of multiple tools against the same configuration
2. Sequential execution of:
   - lora_mover
   - download_configs
   - validation_grid
   - dataset_grid

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Bundle Orchestrator Enhancements
- Improve error handling (continue on individual tool errors)
- Add more detailed progress indicators
- Provide summary of results across all tools
- Add configuration for tool ordering

### Phase 6: Testing & Integration
- Test individual tools in standalone mode
- Test the complete bundle workflow
- Test error scenarios and recovery
- Verify backward compatibility
- Address any integration issues

### Documentation
- Update README with new functionality
- Add examples and usage instructions
- Update help text in easy.py

### Cleanup
- Remove any backup or duplicate files
- Standardize code style across all tools
- Ensure consistent error handling approach

## Progress Tracking
- Implementation started: March 23, 2025
- Initial tools completed: March 23, 2025
- Post-process bundle (pp) basic integration: March 23, 2025
